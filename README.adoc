= Common Jenkins DSL

The repository contains common building blocks for jobs that
use Jenkins Job DSL in the Spring projects.

== How to build it

```
./mvnw clean install
```

== How to use it in Jenkins?

It's more than probable that you'll be using a Gradle to build your
scripts. It's enough for you to set the following values in
your buildscript

[source,groovy]
----
configurations {
	libs
	compile.extendsFrom libs
}

dependencies {
	libs "org.springframework.internal:jenkins-common:${jenkinsCommonVersion}"
}

task libs(type: Copy) {
	into 'build/lib'
	from configurations.libs
}

build.dependsOn libs
----

That way you'll use the `jenkins-common` as a `compile` dependency
but also it will get unpacked to `build/lib` folder.

IMPORTANT: Remember to pass the `build/lib/*.jar` as additional classpath
element of your seed job

Example:

[source,groovy]
----
job('spring-cloud-seed') {
    triggers {
        githubPush()
    }
    scm {
        git {
            remote {
                github('spring-io/build-scripts')
            }
            branch('master')
        }
    }
    steps {
        gradle("clean build")
        dsl {
            external('jobs/springcloud/*.groovy')
            removeAction('DISABLE')
            removeViewAction('DELETE')
            ignoreExisting(false)
            additionalClasspath([
                    'src/main/groovy', 'src/main/resources', 'build/lib/*.jar'
            ].join("\n"))
        }
    }
}
